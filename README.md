# Capstone; Predicting the price of crypto art

The goal of this project is to make a predictive model of the price of crypto art. The data that is used is from the digital gallery SuperRare, the information about the sales is in sales.csv and the information about the artworks is in tokens.csv. The following features are used in the models: 

Id	Features
0	Year
1	Month
2	Week
3	Artist
4	Average Value of artworks of same artist
5	Average Value of artworks past two weeks
6	Buyer
7	Seller

To achieve the goal multiple models were made and optimised.
All the code for this project is written in the capstone notebook.pynb
